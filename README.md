# OCR App
A repository for student software development teams to use in for coursework

## Our next steps
* Create a UI "skeleton" for the app
* Create all the backend magic
* Change the licence as required to a more suitable one
  
## Vision
This is the repository for the application that will allow you to scan a poster etc. find an event, and then add it to your calendar. For second term, you
will be able to scan schedules, as well as share these events with your friends.
  
## Requirements
//external libraries and such - tbd
  
## Building the application
 What steps are there to build this application?

## Testing the build
For now, manual tests. Set up JTests - skeleton file is provided.  
## Running the application
  To use this repository, you need Android Studio with gradle installed.
  You'll also need to have a smartphone virtual machine set up to inspect this application - this can be done inside Android Studio.
  For submission, we will include the .apk file, as well as this repo.
